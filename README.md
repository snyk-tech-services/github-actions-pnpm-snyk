# Github Action for scanning pnpm projects with Snyk

Allows for pnpm projects to be scanned in a similar manner as for npm projects
on Snyk.

## Usage

Steps:

1. Add your Snyk API token as a GitHub secret, e.g. `snykToken`
2. Create `.github/workflows/snyk.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
name: PNPM-PR-Snyk-Check

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, reopened, synchronized]
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  pnpm_snyk_check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Snyk post processing
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: pnpm Snyk Delta
        id: pnpm-snyk-delta
        uses: snyk-tech-services/github-actions-pnpm-snyk@master
        with:
          snykToken: ${{ secrets.snykToken }}
          pnpmLockfilePath: "tests/fixtures/with-tslint/"
          snykOrganization: playground
          # snykArguments: "--severity-threshold=high"
          # breakBuild: "false"
          # fullScan: "false"
```

Once created, any newly opened PR will trigger the workflow. After merging it
into your repo's main branch, it will monitor the project in the corresponding
`snykOrganization`.
